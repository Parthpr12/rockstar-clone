        <div class="sec-divider"></div>
        <p>Rockstar Games is an American video game developer and publisher headquartered in New York City. Founded in December 1998 by British brothers <strong>Sam Houser</strong> and <strong>Dan Houser</strong>, alongside Terry Donovan and Gary Foreman, Rockstar was born with one mission — to push the boundaries of interactive storytelling and open-world design further than anyone had dared before.</p>
        <p>What sets Rockstar apart is not just technical achievement — it's the soul poured into every title. Each game is a living, breathing world with its own culture, dialect, economy, and morality. From the neon-soaked chaos of Vice City to the snow-dusted mountain passes of Red Dead Redemption 2, Rockstar builds places you don't just play in — you <em>live</em> in.</p>
        <p>Over 25+ years, Rockstar has grown into a global powerhouse with studios across New York, Edinburgh, Lincoln, Leeds, Toronto, San Diego, and beyond — united by a single obsession: making the greatest games ever made.</p>

          <h4>WORLD FIRST</h4>
          <p>Every Rockstar game begins with the world — its geography, culture, politics, and social fabric. Story and characters grow organically from their environment.</p>

          <p>RDR2 simulated realistic horse anatomy. GTA V has a functioning stock market affected by player actions. The details nobody asked for are the ones players remember forever.</p>

          <h4>CULTURAL SATIRE</h4>
          <p>Rockstar games hold a mirror to American society — its greed, violence, celebrity culture, and political absurdity. The comedy is always a vehicle for sharp social critique.</p>

          <h4>FREEDOM ALWAYS</h4>
          <p>The player is never a passenger. Every Rockstar world says: explore it, break it, inhabit it. Player agency is sacred — the best moments are the ones you create yourself.</p>
